# LISA-Like-Orbit
This is a repository for the LISA-like orbits data shown in paper [arXiv:1707.09127](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09127)

## Coordinate
J2000 equatorial (Earth mean equator and equinox) solar-system-barycentric coordinate system

## Time Span and step
Initial time: JD2461853.0 (2028-Mar-22 12:00:00 UTC)

Time span: 2200 days

Time step: 1 day

## Folders

The folder of 20280322_LISA_xMkm means the orbital data of the LISA-like configuration with x million kilometer arm length.

e.g. the 20280322_LISA_2p5Mkm is the LISA-like orbit with 2.5 million kilometer arm length, which is the configuration from the LISA proposal in 2017.
